What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It worked to follow the check list and go for a MVP and work my way up. It wasn't immidiately obvious to me what the solution was and my instinct was to both just start coding haphazardly and also to immiediately ask for help. But the best way I learn is to struggle through the problem on my own for a while. So I just needed to calm down and work through it slowly.

I would advise someone to REMAIN CALM and to have faith in their methods of learning
